In C++, the break statement is used to exit a loop or a switch-case block before it finishes normally, allowing the program to jump to the next statement after the loop or switch. It is commonly used to stop execution based on a specific condition. Constants in C++ are fixed values declared using the const keyword, and their value cannot be changed during program execution. They help maintain data integrity and make the code more readable and reliable.
