# ðŸ§ª C++ Experiment 5: Decision Making Statements

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write C++ programs using:
- `if-else` and `nested if` statements  
- `switch case` for handling multiple conditions

---

## âœ… Objectives

ðŸ”¹ Learn how to apply `if-else` and `nested if` in real-life scenarios  
ðŸ”¹ Understand how `switch-case` works and how to use `break` and `exit(0)` effectively  

---

## ðŸ“˜ Theory

### 1. **If-Else Statement**

Used to decide between two paths based on a condition.

#### ðŸ§¾ Syntax:
```cpp
if (condition) {
    // Code runs if condition is true
} else {
    // Code runs if condition is false
}
``` 
Switch Case Statement
Used when we have to choose between many options based on one input variable. Helps reduce multiple if-else if lines. Use break to stop the program from checking more cases and overrwritting it. If no case matches, it runs the default statement.

Syntax
``` 
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code block 
        break;

    case value2:
        // Code block
        break;

    // You can add as many cases as you want.
    default:
        // Code if no case matches
}
``` 
# Program Descriptions
Concepts Used
if-else nested if switch case break and exit(0)

# Sample Programs & Outputs
Check if Number is Even or Odd

``` Enter any number: -23  
The number is negative.
Finding greatese of 3 numbers
``` 
``` Enter 3 numbers: 2 8 0
8 is greatest
Enter 3 numbers: 0 1 1
1 is greatest
Enter 3 numbers: -4 5 4
5 is greatest
Calculator (switch case)
``` 

``` Available operations on the calculator:
A) Addition
B) Subtraction
C) Multiplication
D) Divison
Enter operation you want to do(A,B,C,D): C

Enter num 1:89
Enter num 2:55

Multiplication of the given numbers is 4895
``` 
Checking given alphabet is Vowel or Consonant

``` Enter the alphabet: d
It is a consonant.
Finding day of the week from the input number
``` 

``` Enter number to know the day of the week(1 to 7): 6
Its Saturday...woohoo!
```
